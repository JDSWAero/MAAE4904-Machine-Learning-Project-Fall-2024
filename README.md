"# MAAE4904-Machine-Learning-Project-Fall-2024"
This is the read me file for the Machine Learning course project GitHub, created by Jack Wooldridge.

See conda_environment_setup.txt for the Conda command line input to create an environment that is compatible across the project. Note that the installation may take a few moments due to the size of some libraries. It is recommended to have 8 GB free for the libraries. Some libraries, like pytorch or opencv, may be uninstalled since they are not relevant for this project or other group members.

Python files have multiline comments at the beginning providing a brief summary of the contents and purpose of the file.
